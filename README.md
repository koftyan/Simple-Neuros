# Simple-Neuros
Implementation of simple neuro networks  
Python examples taken from a great book `Grokking Deep Learning - Andrew W. Trask`  
`python` folder - python implementations
- `operations.py`
This file contains some of the vector operations(elementwise multiplication, elementwise addition etc.)
- `simpleNN_1in_1out.py`:  
Simple neural network with 1 input and 1 output.
- `simpleNN_manyIns_1out.py`:  
Simple neural network with many inputs and 1 output.
- `simpleNN_manyIns_1out_np.py`:  
Same but NumPy implementation.
